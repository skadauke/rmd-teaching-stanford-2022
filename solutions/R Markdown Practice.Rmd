## This is a level 2 header

### And this is a level 3 header

It it easy to add plain text in R Markdown.

- This is an unordered list
- This text is **bold**
- This text is *italic*
  - This is a second level sub-item on the list

Place empty lines between paragraphs of text.

Here is a code chunk:

```{r}
plot(ldeaths)
```
